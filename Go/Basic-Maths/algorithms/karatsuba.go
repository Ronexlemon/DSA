/**
The Karatsuba algorithm decreases the number of subproblems to three and ends up calculating the product of two 
n-bit numbers in (n^log2 ^3)

To multiply two 
n-bit numbers, x and y, the Karatsuba algorithm performs three multiplications and a few additions, and shifts on 
smaller numbers that are roughly half the size of the original x and y.
